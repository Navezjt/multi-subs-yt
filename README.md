# Multiple Subtitles Youtube

Youtube has videos that provide subtitles (CC, closed captions) in different languages, but will not display more than one simultaneously on itself's web player. Why not display several at the same time? Why not? 

Nothing fancy, this is a browser addon that works! Watch with two subtitles on. Even more, three, four, five ... Simultaneously.

Display as many as you like! Different languages, translated, auto-generated ...

> Well... It's true that youtube also contains videos of rumous, bias ... Those bad videos show in the recommendation list time and again. Even some videos spreaing rumous are so well-made that misleading lots of people ! And many misled people commenting help rumous to spread

## Notice

1. Sometimes need to refresh the web.
   
   Not a big deal. Still a little annoying right? Yes I feel the same. If you have idea, help solve it.
2. Youtube's machine translation is not good enough. Welcome discussion if you know better API (open an issue on Github).
